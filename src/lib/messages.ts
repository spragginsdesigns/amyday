// The personal letter to Amy using the poem from README.md
export const letterText = `From random moments, laughter took its start,
A "potato" picture, stories of the heart.
Through words exchanged, a different view unfolds,
Of strength and humor, in tales bravely told.

We've walked through fire, though miles keep us wide,
The courts, the worries, nowhere left to hide.
Your fight for children, fierce and true and bold,
A mother's love, worth more than finest gold.
Though fees run high, and battles take their toll,
Your spirit shines, possessing a strong soul.

From Oakhurst mountains to the Fresno scene,
You juggle life, a powerful machine.
With Pierson, Paxton, Presli, by your side,
Through tantrums, laughter, and the turning tide.
You teach them faith, navigate their fears,
A constant rock throughout the passing years.

You speak of struggles, raw and deeply true,
The inner battles only God sees through.
Yet in your honesty, a beauty lies,
Reflected brightly in my grateful eyes.
Your humor, sharp, a coping, I can tell,
Turns difficult moments into stories to compel.

We've talked of health, of journeys hard and long,
Of pills and progress, where you truly belong.
Now strides are taken, pounds begin to fall,
Responding bravely to life's earnest call.
And in this process, finding strength anew,
I'm cheering for you, in all that you pursue.

From thrift store hunts to Bibles comic-styled,
In simple moments, connections are compiled.
A shared meme's chuckle, a knowing, caring glance,
In every message, our unique dance.
You see my flaws, yet offer grace and light,
And in your friendship, things feel truly right.

This space, this tribute, built with love and care,
A reminder always, everywhere.
That you are seen, admired, day by day,
A lovely woman, lighting up the way.
Through highs and lows, whatever life may send,
You have a friend, until the very end.

So breathe it in, let worries softly cease,
Find here a moment of calm, joy, and peace.
A living memory, forever near,
Dispelling shadows, conquering all fear.
For AmyDay is more than just a name,
It's built for you, to rise above the game.`;
