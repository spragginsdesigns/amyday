PLACEHOLDER AUDIO FILES

For the AmyDay application to work correctly, you'll need to add two audio files to this directory:

1. letter.mp3 - A voiceover recording of the letter to Amy
2. background.mp3 - Soft background music to accompany the voiceover

These files are not included in the repository as they are meant to be personal recordings from you to Amy.

Until you add these files, the audio player will appear but will not function correctly.
