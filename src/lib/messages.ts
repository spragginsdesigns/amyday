export const letterText = `

In a world that pulls and tears apart,
You hold your ground with a lion's heart.
God sees the work no one applauds
The sleepless nights, the whispered prayers to God.

Your love for Pierson, Presli, Pax shines bright,
Through every tantrum, every sleepless night.
You teach them grace, through joy and pain,
Planting seeds that will not grow in vain.

The courts may rage, the bills may climb,
But your faith outlasts the weight of time.
You carry burdens no child can see,
Yet smile to shield them, faithfully.

Heaven watches—not a moment missed.
A mother's sacrifice is sacred bliss.
You fight with laughter, love, and grit,
And in God's eyes, that's the highest gift.

You've shown me strength wrapped up in grace,
A warrior's heart with a gentle face.
And while the world may fail to see,
God says, <b>"Well done. You walk with Me."</b>

So pause today—breathe deep, be still,
You are a wonder, and always will.
Not just for what you do, but who you are:
A radiant soul, a mother, God's star.`;
