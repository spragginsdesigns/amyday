In a world that pulls and tears apart,
You hold your ground with a lion's heart.
God sees the work no one applauds
The sleepless nights, the whispered prayers to God.

Your love for Pierson, Presli, Pax shines bright,
Through every tantrum, every sleepless night.
You teach them grace, through joy and pain,
Planting seeds that will not grow in vain.

The courts may rage, the bills may climb,
But your faith outlasts the weight of time.
You carry burdens no child can see,
Yet smile to shield them, faithfully.

Heaven watches—not a moment missed.
A mother's sacrifice is sacred bliss.
You fight with laughter, love, and grit,
And in God's eyes, that's the highest gift.

You've shown me strength wrapped up in grace,
A warrior's heart with a gentle face.
And while the world may fail to see,
God says, <b>"Fear not, for I am with thee."</b>

So pause today—breathe deep, be still,
You are a wonder, and always will.
Not just for what you do, but who you are:
A radiant soul, a mother, God's star.

export const hiddenMessage = `Dear Amy,
The way you show up every day for your kids, for others, and for God honestly amazes me. You wake up early, push yourself at the gym, take care of three little lives, and still make time for Lilly and anyone else who needs you.

Your strength is not just in what you carry. It is in how you carry it. With love, faith, consistency, and quiet determination. Watching you walk through so much and still choose grace has changed the way I understand courage.

You are not just getting through life. You are growing into the woman God made you to be. And it is beautiful.

I hope you never forget how deeply valued you are. How fiercely loved you are. How fully seen you are. By God. And by me.`;
